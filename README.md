This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, install all the dependecies using yar or npm:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn
```

## Update Prisma for DB migration

Make sure to have mysql server running and update the DATABASE_URL in your .env file with correct user, password and db name

```bash
DATABASE_URL="mysql://your_user_name:your_user_password@localhost:3306/name_of_your_database"
```

Then migrate your DB with following command

```bash
npx prisma migrate dev --name init
```

## Start your local server

Start your server with following command

```bash
npm run dev
#or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
